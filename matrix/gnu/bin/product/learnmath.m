This reference and objective of class in elements math about the logic 
of representation linear to solver the problem's physics and math about 
the expression numeric about the values of base solid formed one base 
linear to put the notion linear to form the math about system of calculus 
elements of base linear listed the form used the numeric the values of base 
build to form the type physic of calculus situation needs to logical functional 
method objective of sphere logic of class.
